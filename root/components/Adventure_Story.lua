Wildflowers pepper the ground, their colors dancing in the light breeze. A few yards away, a bubbling brook catches your attention, its crystal-clear water tumbling over smooth stones. You feel a sense of tranquility, but also an undercurrent of uncertainty; you cannot recall how you arrived here or what may lie beyond the thicket of trees that encircles the clearing."
